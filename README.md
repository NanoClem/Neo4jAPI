# Neo4jAPI
A REST API using Neo4j as database agent to interact with data contained in graphs.

## Installation

If you don't have Python installed, [get it here](https://www.python.org/downloads)  
I recommend you to use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to setup a virtual environment. I personnaly used virtualenv, but you're free to choose the one that suits you best.

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
